#Framwork
What is a **framework**?
A framework is a standardised set of concepts,criteria and practices for dealing with a commont type of problem.
The aim for frameworks is to provide  a common structure so that developers dont have to redo it from scratch and
reuse the code provided.

There are basically two types of frameworks:- front-end and backend

The concept of frameworks can be applied to different processes
* the programmer's layer which connects to databases to the site content.
* the designer's layer where docs are presented in HTML docs with defined CSS stylesheets.

There are various html frameworks which include:

1. **HTML5 boilerplate** - a framework that provides useful tools and features which include:
        *analytics,icons and more - lean mobile-friendly template
        *nomarlize.css and helpers - an alternative to CSS resets and further base styles
        *jquerry and modernizr - packed with minified jquerry libraries
        *high performance - delivered with apache settings for excelent site performance
2. **Get skeleton** - used mostly for small projects. It is a light framwork which uses less code. It styles a handful of HTML elements and includes a grid. It is also a responsive boilerplate. It is build with mobile in mind and it isn't a UI framework.
3. **Montagejs** - a html5 framework that supports creating singlepage applications fasr. It allows one to easily create a modular architecture for projects and is easy to learn.Its features are:
       * Reusable components- offers a modular approach to organizing code and components. Small teams can build faster and large teams can break complex problems into small problesm without stepping on each other during development process.
       * High performance - supports implicit event delegation and managed draw cycle. This minimises expensive layout reflows.
       * Component oriented templates - templates are html5 docs which encapsulate a component's javascript code as well as resources like css files and images.
       * Functional reactive bindings - supports simple and two-way data binding between components,objects and collections allowing the developer to coordinate the state between views and models.

It also has a dedicated cloud based visual authoring environment which is free to use.

4. **Zebra** - Framework to develop web based rich UI applications. The approach sits ontop of HTML5 canvas element that can render any imaginable UI.

Zebra UI engine provides various capabilities such as:
* charts
* drag-able panels
* layer to freee input
* dragable-charts
* mouse cursor control
* layouted components
* shaped focusable components
* mouse event handling
